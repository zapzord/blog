"Good afternoon guys this is my first blog hope you liked it!"

did any of you find anything remotely different in the above statement...no?

well, that is today's theme!!

PERSPECTIVE, not only an interesting word to pronounce but also a word with an interesting meaning!

so what I AM trying to convey is what you guys thought was an average statement, was read as a grammatical error by the literature experts

and the very same statement was just a bunch of words to a toddler

or perhaps cringe at the current generation 'sophisticated' teens
or it may have made someone's day! yes, people like that exist who are so lonely that they actually smile after reading even a greeting on the internet!
[P.S if you are one of those we feel you buddy.... don't give up you are the best!!1]

so basically same words same statements are interpreted differently by different people! 

so it is not always your fault if you hurt someone or offend someone maybe you didn't mean it but they thought you did!

so we basically discussed that words possess different powers and potential depending on the person who is speaking and on the person who interprets it.

so keeping it short on my first blog thank you! keep smiling and don't give up on your goal!
